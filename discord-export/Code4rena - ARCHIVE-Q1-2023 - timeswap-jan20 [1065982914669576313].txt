getting the following message when I clone the repo: the following paths have collided (e.g. case-sensitive paths
on a case-insensitive filesystem) and only one from the same
colliding group is in the working tree:

  'packages/v2-token/out/Test.sol/Test.json'

Could you elaborate?


[01/20/2023 20:33] riksucks
Hi! This is because forge standard library has both files Test.sol and test.sol, both serving different purposes, that we make use of, while testing. So you would need a case sensitive fs


[01/20/2023 20:34] riksucks
What you can do is, essentially delete the out directory if you have no interest in building or running tests. And only compile the contracts and not the test contracts

is it possible to run the propery-based tests once, instead of fuzzing it?


[01/21/2023 14:16] peakbolt
the codebase is very well organized and documented. neat! 👍

[01/21/2023 17:17] rickardlarsson6
Anyone managed to run slither?


[01/21/2023 21:17] 0xgusmccrae
i can get it do a partial run if I do "slither ." in the individual workspaces (actually only v2-library and v2-option)


[01/21/2023 21:18] 0xgusmccrae
but it runs into issues when it tries to access files in ../../node_modules since crytic-compile can't access parent directories


[01/21/2023 21:19] 0xgusmccrae
probably can just make a copy of the whole project and paste node_modules into the individual workspaces and then edit the imports for each file to get a full run


[01/21/2023 21:19] 0xgusmccrae
I'm gonna try that


[01/21/2023 22:13] 0xgusmccrae
Yeah, I've now got full slither runs on v2-library and v2-option, but I'm getting an assertion error for v2-pool and v2-token


[01/21/2023 22:13] 0xgusmccrae
but if you paste the openzeppelin and timeswap libraries into v2-option you can get a full run


[01/21/2023 23:00] 0xgusmccrae
made small edit to slither so it skipped the thing that was throwing the error, now I've got it working on all 4 workspaces


[01/22/2023 14:23] giwerutee#2579
Are tests hanging for anyone else on v2-pool?


[01/22/2023 14:48] riksucks
Yup, slither suggests symlinking node modules folder for ease of running the tests. No need to copy dir.

{Reactions}
❤️‍🔥 

[01/22/2023 14:49] riksucks
So the test conditions are kinda time intensive because right random numbers (or fuzz input) needs to be generated, to run the tests


[01/22/2023 14:50] riksucks
Since the conditions are pretty large for pool, compared to options/library, hence it takes time. Do make sure that you have decent compute to run few of those tests


[01/22/2023 14:55] riksucks
What you can do is, create a new test function and call the fuzzed test function with your desired set of inputs.

And if you want to run only the test you wrote urself, use `--match-test` flag


[01/22/2023 14:55] peakbolt
gd point. i created my own test. thanks!

[01/23/2023 14:25] cergyk
@vhawk19 why are there delegate call guards? `noDelegateCall`


[01/23/2023 14:49] vhawk19
its to prevent delegate call happening to methods in a child contract


[01/23/2023 14:52] cergyk
What do you mean by child contract? What would be the impact of somebody doing a delegate call?


[01/23/2023 15:40] vhawk19
To prevent Circumventing the licensing by creating a wrapper contracts which delegates call to timeswap contracts?


[01/23/2023 15:43] cergyk
Okay thanks for the explanation 👍


[01/23/2023 17:56] rickardlarsson6
Very much appreciated!


[01/23/2023 18:45] parsely.
I have read through the documentation, Please may I check, the token0 address < token1 address, is that just by convention (a way to standardize pairs) or is there more to understand. For my own understanding just checking how would a user know which pair to request to have a valid pair option?


[01/23/2023 19:27] vhawk19
Its just a convention as is followed in uniswap.


[01/23/2023 23:54] chaduke3730
what is the difference between mint() of TimeswapV2Token.sol and mint() of TimeswapV2Option.sol?

V2Token is  in a sense wrapper ontop of V2, to wrap liquidity positions such that it can easily be transferred as an ERC1155. V2Token::mint mints the ERC1155 token on transferring the required liquidity token to the token contract.


[01/24/2023 08:40] jm217
@vhawk19 could you share a link to documentation other than the whitepaper?


[01/24/2023 08:40] jm217
where is this from


[01/24/2023 08:58] vhawk19
Currently the documentation in the `Readme.md` and whitepaper is what is prepared, we are working on more documentation.


[01/24/2023 08:59] jm217

Running 4naly3er script I got an error RuntimeError: abort(TypeError: Cannot read property 'contents' of undefined). Build with -s ASSERTIONS=1 for more info in node_modules/solc-0.8.8/soljson.js:1:13012. It occurs when I run script against v2-option, v2-pool and v2-token. I don't have error in v2-library. What am I doing wrong? I am newbie – try to learn and understand.

[01/24/2023 17:31] Aeros#7185
There's a good general overview and technical details on how the specific implementation works, but there isn't much detail on the contracts themselves (e.g. the execution flow between contracts/functions, which parts EOAs directly interact with, etc.)


[01/24/2023 17:34] jm217
I believe this documentation is for V1, while the contest is for V2

More Qs, structure?


[01/24/2023 23:31] CharlesPal#0309
A recommendation to the C4 team: you might consider extending the length for contests like these. I assume many top tier auditors are generally quite busy. With other audits on top, it’s almost impossible to get 100% audit coverage within that time.


[01/25/2023 00:41] Cryptor#9119
Shouldn't that be a good thing? This allows other auditors to earn more rewards. If sponsors devs want top tier auditors, they can contact them directly

{Reactions}
✅ 

[01/25/2023 01:25] CharlesPal#0309
Yeah but as sponsor you don’t care if other auditors earn more rewards. You want the best coverage for your code.


[01/25/2023 01:36] Cryptor#9119
Again, if sponsors want to make sure that top auditors working on their codebase, they can contact them directly for a private audit. I am not understanding your point, so we'll agree to disagree


[01/25/2023 02:09] .qeew

Hi All, I have tried to search on google, but could not find an answer. My question is, in which scenario would a user use the transferPosition call?


[01/26/2023 08:03] vhawk19
To transfer the user position, be it short/long0/long1 from one user to another user?
